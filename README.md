# refactoring-rp3
IMPL Project and Bachelor thesis Grebiel Jos√© Ifill Brito




In order to test the tool both projects, core and extension, are needed. 
Please import both projects. The relevant folders from the repo are:

https://github.com/allprojects/refactoring-rp3/tree/master/RxJavaRefactoringCore

https://github.com/allprojects/refactoring-rp3/tree/master/RxJavaRefactoringExtensionSwingWorker

After importing those 2 projects into eclipse, they should compile. 
Then please select run as a eclipse application. 
A second instance of eclipse should be opened. 
This second instance has a new mene - RxJava Refactorings. 
When you click there, then you can select "SwingWorker to RxJava". 

In case one wants to try the AsyncTasks integration then the project 

https://github.com/allprojects/refactoring-rp3/tree/master/RxJavaRefactoringExtensionAsyncTask 

should be imported as well. 

I haven't though yet evaluate if this extension is exactly doing what Ram's tool did, but it should. 
That's still on my TODOs.

# WARNING!
The tool does not support UNDO. Please do a backup of your projects before starting the refactoring!
