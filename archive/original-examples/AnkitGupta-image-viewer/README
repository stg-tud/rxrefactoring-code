Introduction

The application displays thumbnails of the images on the top bar and on clicking any thumbnail
displays its full size image in the space below.

Technical Specification

The project has been built using Eclipse Galileo IDE. The source directory for the application as well
as the project folder of Eclipse has been included in the main archive. Also the jar for the application is
also included and has the images archived within it.

Code written

I have started with some sample code to display an image in the JlLabel using the icon property of the
JLabel. ThumbnailAction class displays the full size image when the JButton in the JToolbar is
pressed.
Glue components are used to center the buttons in the middle of the JToolbar. The code is commented
at proper places to describe the purpose of the block of code.

How to compile and run the application

cd to the source directory in which the components folder is present. Run the following command to
compile
javac components/ImageViewerApp.java
Now to run the file type
java components.ImageViewerApp

Alternatively the jar file is provided to view the application directly.

Use Executable

The executable can be used directly if Sun jdk or Open jdk environement is installed within the
operating system.
Or alternatively run java -jar ImageView.jar in the console.

Assumptions made

It is assumed that the image paths that are provided to the application in the source would be correct
failing which an error arises displayed in the console.
